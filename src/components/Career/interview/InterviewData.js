So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM..",

Here are some practices to improve performance:  * Code-splitting: Break down your application code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This reduces the initial payload sent to the browser.  * Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for static assets and API responses to minimize redundant server requests.  * Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-render certain pages at build time to improve initial load times and SEO.  * Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Re-generate static content at regular intervals or based on specific events to keep data fresh.  * Data Fetching Strategies: Choose the appropriate data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR) based on content update frequency and performance requirements.",

      answer:
        "A default gateway is a network node that serves as an access point or an entry point for traffic from a local network to external networks.

      answer:
        "A subnet mask is a 32-bit value used in IP networking to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It determines which part of the IP address represents the network address and which part represents the host address. The subnet mask is used in conjunction with the IP address to calculate the network and host addresses of a given network.",

        "DNS is a decentralized naming system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites and other resources on the internet using easy-to-remember domain names, such as www.example.com, instead of numeric IP addresses. DNS plays a crucial role in facilitating the communication and accessibility of network resources.",

      answer:
        "A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between internal trusted networks and external untrusted networks, such as the internet, to protect the internal network from unauthorized access and potential threats.

      answer:
        "NAT is a process used in IP networking to translate IP addresses between different network domains. It allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address when communicating with external networks. NAT provides a way to conserve IPv4 addresses and helps improve network security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.",

        "DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It eliminates the need for manual IP address configuration, making it easier to manage and scale IP-based networks. DHCP servers dynamically allocate IP addresses from a defined pool and provide additional network configuration information to the client devices.",
